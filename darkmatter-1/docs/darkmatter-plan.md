# Cosmic Horizon - darkmatter-1 Testnet Planning

## Disclaimer
- Everything is subject to change. Pay attention to the discord [validator announcement channel] (https://discord.gg/MmaEC8RU3b) for announcements. We are testing complex, opensource beta software. Expect things to break. If the documentation is inadequate, make a PR.

## Code Of Conduct

- Testnet tokens are limited and valuable assets for the testnet. It is restricted/not allowed to receive external delegations. One should not try to increase their voting power by spamming the faucet. But it is encouraged to increase their stake by re-staking their rewards.  There are no incentives related to the number of tokens you attain.  The faucet should be used as a utility.  
- We expect formal and professional behaviour from the participants and encourage a healthy competition, as well as healthy cooperation. Any misbehaviour will potentially disqualify one from the contest. This includes trolling channels, and being dismissive or rude to teammembers or other testnet participants.  
- Participating as a group or running validators from multiple accounts should be strictly avoided and any hint on such activities would disqualify users staraight away. Everyone involved would get ZERO rewards. We are not running this testnet to uncover cartel behavior.  There are testnets where that is perfectly acceptable and encouraged, find those test nets. Don't encourage your friends to spin up nodes just for the rewards sake.
- If a user is flagged or blocked on Discord/Github/Twitter will be considered ineligible. 
- Same account/name should be used throughout the testnet. It's not allowed to raise PRs from different github accounts.
